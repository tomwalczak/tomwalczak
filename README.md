> Current AI tools give plausible-sounding answers, but don't provide assurance those answers have been stress-tested. You can't verify where they got their information. You can't see what they missed. I'm building systems that provide that assurance.

## What I'm Building

### Open Debate
**Open-source AI debate system for stress-testing arguments**

AI can get very good at stress-testing arguments — not by being an automatic truth-finder, but by being expert at presenting, challenging, and evaluating reasoning. Bad arguments are built on weak foundations. When pressed, they fall apart.

- Recursive self-improvement for AI debaters
- Vanilla baseline configuration for surfacing model bias
- Human-in-the-loop coaching mode
- CLI-first, integrates with Claude Code for analysis

**Coming soon**: Public release at [open-debate.ai](https://open-debate.ai)

### AlexAI
**Conversational AI embodying energy expert Alex Epstein's thinking**

A production AI system that captures and communicates ideas from *Fossil Future* and *The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels*. Not a chatbot wrapper — a full knowledge base with 900+ indexed sound bites, timeless principles, and expert consensus critiques.

- **AlexAI** — Public-facing conversational AI → [alexepstein.ai](https://alexepstein.ai)
- **AlexAI Pro** — Research-oriented tool for the team with stricter guardrails
- **Commentary Engine** — AI-powered news analysis and content generation

[**What 200+ AI Debates Taught Me About Truth-Finding**](https://tomwalczak.substack.com) — Building the AI judge turns out to be the hardest problem. Framing beats evidence. Mode collapse is real.

## What I'm Thinking About

**Truth-seeking AI** — Current AI tools give plausible-sounding answers, but don't provide confidence those answers have been stress-tested. Open Debate is designed to change that. Show what was looked at, what was reviewed, and that the review was thorough.

**Verification for arguments** — What we call "verifiable" for code and math, we could call "truth-seeking" for complex controversial topics. This is the next frontier after formal verification.

**The 100x public intellectual** — AI doesn't replace human judgment. It amplifies it. The humans who learn to work with AI will have dramatically more impact than those who don't.
