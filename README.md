> I'm building AI agents that verify their reasoning on complex, controversial questions — surfacing counter-arguments, stress-testing logic, and turning confusion into clarity. This will 100x intellectual work and make real-time fact-checking possible.

## What I'm Building

### Open Debate
**Open-source AI debate system for stress-testing arguments**

AI can get very good at stress-testing arguments — not by being an automatic truth-finder, but by being expert at presenting, challenging, and evaluating reasoning. Bad arguments are built on weak foundations. When pressed, they fall apart.

- Recursive self-improvement for AI debaters
- Vanilla baseline configuration for surfacing model bias
- Human-in-the-loop coaching mode
- CLI-first, integrates with Claude Code for analysis

**Coming soon**: Public release at [open-debate.ai](https://open-debate.ai)

### AlexAI
**Conversational AI embodying energy expert Alex Epstein's thinking**

A production AI system that captures and communicates ideas from *Fossil Future* and *The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels*. Not a chatbot wrapper — a full knowledge base with 900+ indexed sound bites, timeless principles, and expert consensus critiques.

- **AlexAI** — Public-facing conversational AI → [alexepstein.ai](https://alexepstein.ai)
- **AlexAI Pro** — Research-oriented tool for the team with stricter guardrails
- **Commentary Engine** — AI-powered news analysis and content generation

### Blumberg AI
**AI agent for venture capital deal flow**

Built an AI agent for Blumberg Capital that screens incoming pitch decks, scores deals against investment criteria, and syncs with the CRM — making the VC process faster and more founder-friendly.

## What I'm Thinking About

**Truth-seeking AI** — Verification is what makes the 10x-100x productivity gains in software engineering possible — agents can keep running, check their own work, and iterate. I'm building the equivalent for intellectual work: AI agents that verify their reasoning on complex, controversial topics.

**The 100x public intellectual** — AI doesn't replace human judgment. It amplifies it. The humans who learn to work with AI will have dramatically more impact than those who don't.
